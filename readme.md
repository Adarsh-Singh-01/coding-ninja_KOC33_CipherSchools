# This project is basically based upon a python programm which works in such a way we can easily find our classmates contact by just searching their names.

# We can also get full list of person's name with their contact number.

# This Project shows off capability of doing daily life things with just writing a python code.


#   DISADVANTAGES
#  The main disadvantage of this code is currently is that person's name should be written in a proper manner with spaces, proper uppercase and lowercase letters.
